# 60 Days of Learning 2025

Welcome to my **#60DaysOfLearning2025** challenge organized by **@lftechnology** under the **#LearningWithLeapfrog** initiative.

Over the next 60 days (starting June 1, 2025), I’ll be diving deep into the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) — building projects, exploring core concepts, and improving my full-stack web development skills.

Stay tuned for daily updates, code snippets, notes, and mini-projects as I document everything I learn in this journey!
